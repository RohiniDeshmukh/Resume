## Experience

**Software Engineer (Research Fellowship)** - Machine Psychology, UMass Boston, MA  
September 2023 – Present
- Conducted research on JavaScript-based medical image processing libraries such as Cornerstone.js, Niivue.js, OpenSeaDragon.js, Papaya.js, and XTK.js for visualizing high-resolution medical scans on 2D and 3D web canvases.
- Developed and presented project PowerBoost at BrainHack 2024, leading a three-person team to enhance the functional capabilities of the UI widget and maintaining the code base using version control tools such as GitHub.
- Co-authored and submitted a paper at IEEE VIS 2024 aiming to provide a web plugin for image processing.
- **Advisor:** Prof. Daniel Haehn | [mpsych lab](https://mpsych.org/)

**API Integration Intern** - Calix, San Jose, California  
May 2023 - August 2023
- Assisted in the integration of third-party APIs using Flask, enhanced data flow, and application functionality.
- Developed RESTful API endpoints to process HTTP requests, conducted testing to verify integration success, utilized SQL for database management tasks, including querying and updating data, and created documentation for API integrations.

**Software Developer** - Germin8, Mumbai, Maharashtra  
June 2021 - July 2022
- Collaborated in revamping the user interface of Germin8’s social media analytics platform by migrating from a traditional frontend to the React framework, enhancing the software development life cycle resulting in a 30% increase in user engagement.
- Developed a scalable backend service using Node.js by implementing data processing pipelines and optimizing database interactions, ensuring that our services could efficiently handle up to 200,000 requests per day.
- Wrote comprehensive unit and integration tests, achieving 100% test coverage. This rigorous testing process guaranteed that the application remained reliable and stable, even as new features were added.

## Projects

**Floating UI Widget for Web Browser with Expanding and Collapsing Action Menu:**
- Designed a project PowerBoost.js, a floating UI widget with an expand and collapse action menu, compatible with any browser via JavaScript injection, featuring a search recommendation system listing all possible Boostlets.
- Developed an editor mode using Ace.js, allowing users to compile and run JavaScript code, and integrated Powerboost.js with Boostlet.js to display Boostlets according to their categories, following a modular architecture and OOP principles.
- Utilized Node Parcel for bundling the source code into a minified JS file, providing easy installation using a bookmarklet for users to dynamically load the script on any host website by dragging and dropping PowerBoost onto the bookmark bar.

**Visualize a 3D Model of the Human Heart in Response to the ECG Signals:**
- Developed a project Cardiowave, an ECG visualization tool utilizing Three.js to render a 3D model of the human heart on a web browser, enabling interactive and realistic heart visualizations.
- Researched and evaluated various 3D visualization canvases, including XTK.js, Three.js, and WebGL, to determine the most effective approach for rendering the heart model and accurately visualizing ECG data.
- Implemented an interface that allows users to drop ECG data files into a browser drop zone, extracting and analyzing P, Q, R, S, and T peaks, and dynamically pumping heart atriums and ventricles based on the analyzed peaks, transitioning from Python libraries (Biosppy.py and NeuroKit.py) to a full JavaScript implementation for enhanced performance and flexibility.

**Web Scraping and Analysis Tool Used to Perform 4 Types of Analysis:**
- Extracted extensive financial data from Yahoo Finance, including stock prices, historical data, and financial news. The data was then subjected to detailed descriptive and regression analysis to uncover patterns and trends for data analytics.
- Utilized Matplotlib to create visualizations, such as line plots, and performed text analysis to generate word clouds, providing a visual representation of the most frequently occurring words in financial news articles.
- Using the NLTK library, the project conducted sentiment analysis on Yahoo Finance news articles. This analysis revealed a strong correlation between stock prices and the sentiments expressed in the news.
